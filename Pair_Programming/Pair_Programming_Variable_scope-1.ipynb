    "# Variable Scope in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "When we define a variable in Python when we are not within a function or class, that variable is said to be *Global* meaning it is *visible*,  (visible means we can read the variable and also alter it).   If we define a variable within a function or class, it is said to be *local* to the class,  and it is not visible in the global workspace, only within the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making variables *local* or *global* is important in *protecting* variables from unexpected changes.   This becomes critical in very large programming projects.\n",

    "Python is a relatively permissive language,  it does not do as well at protecting data as many other languages."
